//		This  is one of the most IMPORTANT INTERVIEW QUESTION.
//
//		Cache is a Memory which is very close to CPU and which has a very less access Time.It is Fast
//		and small in size.
//
//		LRU -> Least Recently Used.
//
//		The Concept of LRU is used in temporal locality, it means that the item is accessed now will be
//		used in Future. In LRU we keep the recently items in the CACHE and we remove the least recent items
//		when we need space in the small size memory.
//
//		When Something is not there in the cache we call it miss and if we are accessing something in the cashe
//		that is already in there then we call it a hit.

//		Refer to the notes in the Copy and proceed further.
