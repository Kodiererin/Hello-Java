{
//	What is Serialization and DeSerialization
//	We are given a Binary Tree where the root of the Binary Tree is the input and we have to convert the Binary Tree into String/Array
//	in such a way that we can construct it Back to the TREE with the help of the information which we store in String or Array.

//	Serialization : The process of COnverting a Binary Tree to String or an Array is called Serialization.
//	Deserialization : The process of Converting Back  the String or an Array to the Binary Tree is called DeSerialization.

//	Application :

//	1: Consider you have a tree but you want to send the tree via network to oters then you need to Serialize the tree into a String so that the tree
//		can be send across the network.
//	2: If you are setting a problems like at GFG Practise then you need to write test cases and you need to generate Strings for people whose programs
//		you are gonna test the problems. Those Programs must read the String and Construct the Tree.

//	Proceed to the Next Class futher Operations.
