package concept_BinarySearchTree;

//	Binary Search tree is such a tree in which you can skip a item.
//	1. For every node, Keys in left side are smaller and keys in the right are greater.
//	2. All keys are typically considered as distinct.
//	3. Like linked List, it is a Linked Data structure.
//	4. Implemented in C++ as map,set, multimap and multiset and in Java it is Tree set and Tree Map.
//	In Linked Data Structure you donot need any Size, You can insert as mush you need.
//	Disadvantage is it is Not cache friendly.
//	Datastructure ie: Binary Tree, Linked List  is Not cache friendly because its data are stored in different locations.
//	Binary search tree is same represented as Binary Trees.
//	Only Special abotu it is it has a special insert operation.
//	Also the order must be mainted while deleting the Binary Node.
