Sorting in Java
Sorting in Java are of two types :
	 	1. Arrays.sort()
						a. Arrays of Primitives Datatype(int,char,float) [Jiska Primitive Datatype ho.]
						b. Array of objects: (String, Integer,Student etc..)
								Which will be based on Merge Sort.
		2. Collection.sort()
						a. for lists(Array List , Linked List )
						for List Mergesort and timsort is widely used.
						where Timsort is uses 2 sorting algorithm Quick sort and Mergesort.
						MergeSort for sorting short size arrays.
						Quicj Sort for Sorting Large Arrays.
						
1. Collection are there for Primitive Datatypes.
2. Collection.sort are only available for list Interface collections.
3. Array List, LinkedList cannot have String, Integer ie: Wrapper Class. 


4. Dual Pivot sort is slightly fast.
5. TimSort is widely used in Python and ensures stability.

6. Stability : Stability means while sorting when any multiple elements are same then their order are not changed while sorting.

	While playing with objects Stability is always preferred.
	In primitive datatype Stability is not required.
	In Non Primitive datatype Stability is Requied.
