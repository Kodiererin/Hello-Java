AWT was from Begining of Java.
 Java is Platform independent but AWT is platform Dependent.

 Heavy Weight : as it interacts with OS to function
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Swing : Also called JVC
 We can create an Object which will have its own look and feel but in AWT it dosent have its own look and feel.
 We can change the look and feel of a Java application.
 Swing carries its own look and feel which is GOOD.

Components like : Tab Pain , Color chooser, Frames inside another frame.
Look and feel : Metal Default , Nnimbus , Motif , Windows , Windows classis (ise hm aasan bhasha me theme vi bol skte h)
